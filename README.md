__Bullbol || An Event Management System__

This project represents a solution for a critical problem that students/deans run through at King Abdullah II for Information Technology (KASIT) faculty which is staying up-to-date with the events that are being held daily in the campus and providing a log for already finished events along with their details.
Please check the documentation for more info.

The code included is the system's frontend which shows the main features and the flow of experience for users when using the system.
Please check the User Manual for the interface.
